1. Software Wizard of the West
2. Future Full Stack Software Developer passionate about using code to solve real world problems!
3. My coding journey isn't exactly your typical one. I first became enamored with Computer Science in 2013 while working on my engineering undergrad at UW Seattle where I took as many computer science classes as electives as I could within my Industrial Engineering Degree. However, after completing a software oriented internship in 2015, I launched into military service as an Aviation Officer in 2016. But starting in 2022,  after leaving full time military service I decided to be fully vested in Software Development and attend the intensive 5-month software bootcamp that Code Fellows has to offer. I am excited to be returning to Software to fill out my burgeoning skillset and start a meaningful career solving unique problems with innovative solutions as a Full Stack Software Developer.
4. The fields that most excite me are automation, especially self-driving cars, and virtual reality.
